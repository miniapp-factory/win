512x512
A stylized rocket ship in the center of a dark space background, surrounded by floating math operation symbols (×, ÷, +, –) and orbiting numbers or equations. The rocket emits a subtle trail of glowing particles that resemble mathematical symbols, creating a dynamic, game‑appropriate “Math Blast” theme. The design is scalable, suitable for both a favicon and a main logo, and uses a color palette that complements the dark space theme of the game.
