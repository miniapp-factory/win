+Math Rocket Defender is a simple 2D game where math problems fall from the top of the screen, and the player types the correct answer to solve them. The game starts on a space-themed screen where the player can choose an operation: Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction, or All. Once the game begins, a rocket sits at the bottom-center of the screen, and problems fall from the top. The active problem is highlighted in orange, while others remain white. The player types the answer in a field at the bottom. If the answer is correct, the rocket fires and the problem disappears; if incorrect, the input shakes and shows a red border. The layout is simple, mobile-friendly, and focuses on clear visuals and smooth animations.
+
+Place the math rocket defender to the home page.
